測定日: 2026-09-15  
Version: 0.2.0  
対象: Blender 5.2.1 LTS / `RepresentativeAvatar-CaseA-Ver1.3.1.unitypackage`

## Automated Verification

- Python tests: 41 PASS
- `compileall`: PASS
- Blender 5.2.1 synthetic integration: PASS
- `register()` / `unregister()`: PASS
- ZIP `testzip`: None

## Reference Package

- Import: `FINISHED`
- Objects / Meshes / Armatures: 113 / 103 / 4
- Shape Keys: 40
- Images: 112
- Material slot bindings: 147 / 147 MATCH
- Material GUID mismatch: 0
- Texture GUID mismatch: 0
- Missing filepath: 0

## BUG-002 / BUG-003

- BUG-002: CLOSED. Identity chain and save/reopen binding persistence are verified.
- BUG-003: CLOSED. 48 / 48 textured materials reach the active Material Output.
- Duplicate Principled BSDF: 0
- Duplicate Material Output: 0
- Japanese UI lookup failure: 0
- Japanese save/reopen: 147 / 147 binding MATCH, node/link graph MATCH

## VIS-010 Human Verification

PASS, user-reported on 2026-09-15 in Blender 5.2.1 Japanese UI Material Preview:

- Face / Skin
- Hair
- SampleGarment / Clothes
- Gloves
- Accessories
- MAGENTA: none
- White-only rendering: resolved

## Current Limitations / Unverified

- Transparent / cutout / blend material visual path is not validated by the reference package.
- File Browser cancel/re-run, arbitrary Prefab manual selection, and normal UI Undo-key behavior are not confirmed.
- Unity shader appearance remains an approximation.
- Multi-package integration and UnityPackage exporter are not complete.

Historical evidence remains under `experiment_logs/`; those files are not modified by the 0.2.0 freeze.
# 0.3.0 Candidate Verification (2026-09-15)

- Editable Texture ETX-001..009: PASS in Blender 5.2.1 integration test, including same Image datablock, same filepath, material binding, identity, `.blend` reopen, missing-source refusal, dirty refusal, packed conflict, and no copy/backup.
- ETX-010 real-package identity/reload automation: PASS; Face/Hair/SampleGarment representatives present. Material Preview UI visual inspection: UNVERIFIED because Computer Use was unavailable.
- Python: 41/41 PASS. `compileall`: PASS. Synthetic Blender integration: PASS. Real package: 113 objects / 103 meshes / 4 armatures / 40 shape keys / 147 bindings / identity errors 0.
- Version metadata is now `(0, 3, 0)` as a candidate only; 0.2.0 remains the frozen baseline.
